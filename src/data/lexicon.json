The class documents extensive community amenities ranging from recreational facilities like pools, clubhouses, gyms, and golf courses to modern conveniences such as co-working spaces, package lockers, and rooftop decks. Additionally, it tracks security features including 24/7 guards, gated entries, surveillance systems, keycard access, and other safety measures. This information is crucial for property buyers to understand community living costs, available facilities, governance structure, and security provisions when evaluating properties within HOA-managed communities.",

It defines physical attachment relationships through attachment types (attached, detached, semi-detached) and categorizes properties by unit count for mortgage banking purposes, ranging from single-family homes to multi-unit properties up to fourplexes, which directly impacts loan-to-value ratios, debt-to-income requirements, and lending risk assessments. The class maintains critical legal documentation including unique parcel identifiers that distinguish properties within jurisdictions and detailed legal descriptions outlining exact boundaries, dimensions, and governmental recognition for contracts and legal documents. It captures construction timeline data through built year information and provides extensive property type classifications spanning residential options from single-family detached homes and condominiums to manufactured housing, cooperatives, timeshares, and multi-family units. This comprehensive property classification system is essential for mortgage underwriting, legal documentation, zoning compliance, insurance purposes, and real estate market analysis, ensuring accurate property categorization across various real estate transactions and regulatory requirements.",

The number of units type is used to determine the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, and other loan requirements, as well as the risk associated with the property.\n\nFor example, rdf:type single-family home may have more favorable lending terms than rdf:type multi-unit property, as the latter may be seen as rdf:type higher risk due to the potential for multiple tenants and increased maintenance costs.",

The class documents physical attributes including flooring materials, square footage, floor levels, and window specifications with various design types and treatments. It captures aesthetic elements such as design style, decor features, lighting fixtures, countertop materials, and cabinet styles, while also assessing condition factors like paint quality, flooring wear, clutter levels, and visible damage. For pool and spa areas, it includes specialized properties for equipment, safety features, surface types, and water quality. The class also evaluates environmental factors such as natural light quality, views, and furnishing status, making it essential for property appraisals, virtual tours, maintenance planning, and detailed property marketing descriptions.",

It captures location details including names, precise distances in miles with decimal precision, and categorical classifications spanning shopping, dining, entertainment, nature, fitness, beaches, historical sites, parks, museums, recreation, pet services, wellness facilities, and tourist attractions. The class includes extensive feature specifications ranging from retail options (grocery stores, malls, boutiques) and dining establishments (cafes, fine dining, food trucks) to recreational facilities (hiking trails, gyms, golf courses) and specialized amenities (pet services, spa treatments, cultural exhibits). It also evaluates practical accessibility through walkability assessments, helping property buyers understand transportation needs and pedestrian-friendly neighborhood characteristics. This data is crucial for lifestyle matching, property marketing, neighborhood analysis, and helping potential residents assess proximity to essential services, entertainment options, and recreational opportunities that align with their preferences and daily needs.",

The origination date is important because it is used to calculate the loan's term, which is the length of time over which the borrower will make payments on the loan."

Each payment reduces the principal balance of the loan, and over time the loan is gradually paid off in full. In a partially amortizing loan, the borrower makes regular payments that include both principal and interest, but the payments are not large enough to fully pay off the loan by the end of its term. As a result, at the end of the loan term, the borrower must either make a balloon payment to pay off the remaining balance, refinance the loan, or enter into another agreement with the lender.",

The lower the HCLTV ratio, the more equity the homeowner has in their property and the lower the risk to the lender. Lenders generally prefer rdf:type HCLTV ratio of 80% or lower.\n\nIn addition to the HCLTV ratio, lenders also consider other factors such as the borrower's credit score, income, and debt-to-income ratio, among others, when deciding whether to approve a home equity loan or line of credit."
